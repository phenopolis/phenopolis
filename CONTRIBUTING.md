# How to contribute
## Automated build and test
We use Travis CI to [build and test](https://travis-ci.org/phenopolis/phenopolis) all commits and follow the practices of [continuous integration](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration). Our master branch must always be in a working state. Only pull requests that have a passing build will be considered for merging in to master. Broken builds on master branch must be fixed immediately (by reverting the commit if necessary).

Please include tests with your pull request. We use Coveralls to monitor and analyse [test coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/phenopolis/phenopolis?branch=master). 

We also run [Scrutinizer's static analysis.](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/phenopolis/phenopolis/)

## Code reviews
We review each other's code before merging a pull request in to the master branch. Please select reviewer from the menu when setting up your pull request.

# Communication
- We have a Slack team for general discussions. Please get in touch with [Nikolas Pontikos](https://github.com/pontikos) for access.
- GitHub issues are the primary way we communicate about specific proposed changes.
- Use Github pull requests for code reviews and to discuss proposed code contributions.
