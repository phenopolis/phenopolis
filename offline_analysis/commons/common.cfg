[db]
# commonly used data stored in offline_analysis/db
# tigerm data served from genenetwork, on RNA expression on retina. 
# Database Name: TIGEM_Human_Retina_RNA-Seq_Sep16_RPKM_log2
# GeneNetwork Accession Number: GN802
# For more information regarding this data set please visit: http://www.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=sharinginfo&GN_AccessionId=802
#
# Z-Score.
# In general, the array data that we enter in GeneNetwork have been log transformed and then z-score normalized, but instead of leaving the mean at 0 and the standard deviation of 1 unit,
# the data is rescaled to a mean of 8 units with a standard deviation of 2 units (what we call 2Z + 8 normalized data).

# vp_ratio is variants_to_patients ratio. It is a good place to check and help remove negative results. For dominant cases, this ratio should be close to 1, if most of the carriers have distinctive variants on the gene. For recessive cases, this ratio should be close to 2. Should do some stats to determine the best cutoffs.

[pubmedScore]
# how often you would like to re-search on pubmed for new result
# searched results are stored locally and linked to the search keywords. if re-search on the same keywords, it would fetch local storage unless last search was done `lifetime` ago (in second). default: 2592000 = 1 month
# change it to 1 if you want to search pubmed, regardless of the cached result
lifetime=2592000
# your email for pubmed search. if anything goes wrong on your pubmed-search, NCBI will use this email for notification.
